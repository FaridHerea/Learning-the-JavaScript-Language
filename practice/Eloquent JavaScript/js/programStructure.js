//FizzBuzz

//print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

//Chessboard

// # # # #
//# # # # 
// # # # #
//# # # # 
// # # # #
//# # # # 
// # # # #

//When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works 
//for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
